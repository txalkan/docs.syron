# Terms of Service

**Effective Date:** July 19, 2025

## Introduction

The user interfaces operated by TyronDAO (the "Interfaces") are open-source frontends to the Tyron Web3 protocols (the "Protocols"), a decentralized collection of blockchain smart contracts and tools.

The Protocols are open-source under AGPLv3.

## 2. Service Description

**Decentralized Protocols:** The Protocols such as Syron, developed by TyronDAO, enable BTC-overcollateralized stablecoins through smart contract accounts. These function as safety deposit boxes for minting Syron stablecoins.

**Non-Custodial:** We do not control your wallet funds, private keys, or digital assets. You maintain full control and responsibility.

**Open Source:** The code is publicly available under AGPLv3. Third parties can create alternative interfaces to the same Protocols.
