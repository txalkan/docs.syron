# Token

The Syron dollar (SU$D) is a stablecoin crafted as a digital fungible token, seamlessly usable on the Bitcoin network and ZK-rollups. As a Bitcoin-native asset, it adheres to the [BRC-20 standard](https://layer1.gitbook.io/layer1-foundation/protocols/brc-20).

**What is a fungible token?**

A fungible token is interchangeable with others of the same type and value. Each unit is identical and can be traded on a one-to-one basis. Fungible tokens are divisible and lack uniqueness, making them uniform and easily exchangeable, similar to money.

The fungible token infrastructure is a vital component of Syron's core design, capable of residing both on Bitcoin and layer-2 solutions for enhanced scalability and accessibility.
