# Token

The Syron U$ dollar (SU$D) is a stablecoin crafted as a digital fungible token, seamlessly usable on the Bitcoin network, Internet Computer and other platforms. As a Bitcoin-native asset, it adheres to the [BRC-20 standard](https://layer1.gitbook.io/layer1-foundation/protocols/brc-20) for holding and transferability.

**What is a fungible token?**

A fungible token is interchangeable with others of the same type and value. Each unit is identical and can be traded on a one-to-one basis. Fungible tokens are divisible and lack uniqueness, making them uniform and easily exchangeable, similar to money.

The fungible token infrastructure is a crucial aspect of the stablecoin metaprotocol's core design. It's designed to operate seamlessly on Bitcoin and other blockchain protocols, offering improved scalability and accessibility.
