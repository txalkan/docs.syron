# Liquidation

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** Liquidation in the context of Syron refers to the process of repaying a debtor's SUSD loan and receiving the debtor's collateral in return. Since Syron USD is over-collateralized with Bitcoin, the value of the collateral exceeds the value of the loan. As a result, the liquidator, who repays the SUSD loan, earns a BTC surplus that represents a profit.

By understanding the liquidation process in Syron, you can better appreciate the mechanisms that ensure the stability and reliability of Syron USD as a stablecoin. Liquidation not only protects the system from depegging (i.e., SUSD losing its parity with the USD due to under-collateralized loans) but also provides financial opportunities for liquidators like you: Be Your Own ₿ank.

- **a.** If you have the necessary balance to perform the liquidation of the chosen SBD, the verification will be successful, and you can proceed.

- **b.** If your balance is insufficient, you have to deposit SUSD into your own SDB from any Bitcoin wallet, such as UniSat.

3. **Complete the Payment**: Once your account is successfully verified, click on the Confirm button, wait for the request to process, and then enjoy your BTC, which you will receive directly in your wallet.
