{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** Burning is the process of removing Syron U$ dollars from circulation according to Tyron's stablecoin metaprotocol code.
{% endhint %}

The purpose of burning SU$D stablecoins is for users to recover or redeem the bitcoin cryptocurrency (BTC) stored in their safety deposit boxes (SD₿).

To do so, a SU$D deposit must be made into the user's SD₿, and then proceed to call the Syron minter canister to request the transfer of BTC from the SD₿ to the user's wallet.
