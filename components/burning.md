{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** Burning is the process of removing Syron US dollars from circulation according to the Syron stablecoin meta-protocol.
{% endhint %}

The purpose of burning SUSD stablecoins is for users to recover or redeem the bitcoin cryptocurrency (BTC) stored in their safety deposit boxes (SD₿).

To do so, a Syron deposit must be made into the user's SD₿, and then proceed to call TyronDAO's canister on the Internet Computer to request the transfer of BTC from the SD₿ to the user's wallet.
