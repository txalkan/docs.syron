# :zap: Syron U$ Dollar (SU$D)

## What's SU$D?

SU$D is a self-sovereign identity (SSI) stablecoin pegged to USD, empowering you to retain ownership of your Bitcoin-native assets. This unique feature enables you to effortlessly access instant USD liquidity whenever needed, essentially allowing you to become your own bank. Think of it as a modern-day gold standard, but with digital assets of limited supply instead of gold.

Starting with BRC-20 as the inaugural supported collateral, Syron ensures that your tokens are securely held within your control in your SSI Vault. This setup allows you to unlock dollars for various purposes, whether for spending or investment. SU$D plays a pivotal role in bridging the stability of the U.S. dollar with Bitcoin's growth potential, contributing to the creation of a more inclusive financial world.

You retain control over your tokens' value, allowing them to grow while still having dollars available for whatever you desire.
