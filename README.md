# :zap: Syron U$ Dollar

## What's SU$D?

Syron is a Bitcoin-native stablecoin (SU$D) integrated with the Internet Computer at the protocol level, designed to provide seamless access to USD liquidity and decentralized finance (DeFi). Empowering you with self-sovereign identity (SSI), SU$D allows you to retain ownership of your assets while accessing instant USD liquidity whenever needed. It's like having a modern-day gold standard but with digital assets of limited supply instead of gold.

The SSI Protocol ensures that your collateral is securely held within your control in your SSI Vault. This setup allows you to mint SU$D tokens for various purposes, whether for spending or investment. Syron is a Bitcoin-native stablecoin that uses the Ordinals Protocol to combine the stability of the U.S. dollar with Bitcoin's growth potential, contributing to the creation of a more inclusive financial world.
