# Be Your Own ₿ank

## What is Syron?

Syron is a stablecoin metaprotocol running on Bitcoin mainnet and integrating with the Internet Computer at the protocol level. This groundbreaking "Chain Fusion" enables you to use your existing Bitcoin wallet as your Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) — no extra wallets or bridges required.

Designed to expand access to fiat-denominated liquidity and decentralized finance, Syron preserves Bitcoin’s core principles of security and decentralization.

As Tyron's sovereign currency metaprotocol, Syron enables **capital-efficient Bitcoin loans** while ensuring BTC is stored in a separate, auditable **Safety Deposit ₿ox**. This lets you access liquidity without sacrificing ownership or security.

Being your own ₿ank means you can leverage your Bitcoin (BTC) holdings to mint Syron stablecoins while retaining full custody. Empowered by SSI solutions, Tyron allows you to maintain ownership of your BTC and tap into instant fiat-denominated liquidity — all without intermediaries. It’s like a modern-day gold standard, but built on Bitcoin: a digitally scarce, decentralized asset.

TyronDAO ensures that your collateral remains fully under your control within your Safety Deposit ₿ox. This unique setup allows you to mint Syron stablecoins for various purposes, whether for spending, investment, or even **acquiring more Bitcoin**.

Syron SUSD — the first implementation of the protocol — uses the Ordinals BRC-20 standard to combine the stability of the U.S. dollar with Bitcoin’s long-term potential, helping build a more inclusive financial system.

Imagine this: you have 1 BTC and need $20,000 in liquidity. With Syron, your Bitcoin stays securely stored in a Safety Deposit ₿ox while you instantly mint SUSD. Use it to buy more BTC, make purchases, or explore new investments. You retain full control over your Bitcoin's value, allowing it to appreciate while having accessible funds for immediate needs.
