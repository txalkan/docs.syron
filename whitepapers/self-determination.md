# The Crisis of Self-Determination in the Age of Centralized States & Currencies

> **TL;DR**  
> This paper outlines the design, rationale, and real-world applications of Syron — a bitcoin-backed metaprotocol for issuing overcollateralized stablecoins. Drawing on case studies such as Gaza and the constraints faced by indigenous and LGBTQ+ communities, it argues for a decentralized alternative to state-controlled monetary systems. Built on Bitcoin Layer 1 and powered by the Internet Computer, Syron allows users to mint stablecoins (e.g., SUSD, Syron Shekel) while maintaining full custody of BTC collateral. This framework aims to support practical financial self-determination through transparent, programmable, and community-aligned tools.

## Abstract

This whitepaper offers a deeper exploration of Syron, a bitcoin-collateralized metaprotocol for sovereign currency issuance, building on previous foundational materials released by TyronDAO. As Syron advances from conceptual design into active testing, this document examines its evolution as a response to the systemic limitations of centralized state currencies. Drawing from examples of financial exclusion — from Gaza to stateless and indigenous communities — Syron proposes a decentralized alternative grounded in self-custody and relational liberalism. Powered by Bitcoin Layer 1 and the Internet Computer, Syron enables the creation of overcollateralized, fiat-pegged stablecoins that preserve financial autonomy and foster inclusive, community-driven economies. This paper outlines the theoretical foundations, technical architecture, and socio-political implications of Syron’s model.

## The Challenge of Monetary Self-Determination

Across the world, centralized fiat currencies have functioned as tools of control — reinforcing economic dependency, weakening local governance, and constraining the financial autonomy of entire communities. These dynamics are particularly evident in the experiences of indigenous groups such as the Mapuche and the Kurds, who are routinely denied both territorial rights and access to economic self-determination. Likewise, LGBTQ+ communities face systemic financial exclusion, especially in some Muslim-majority countries where state control is closely intertwined with conservative religious doctrines. From the humanitarian crisis in Gaza to the structural exclusion endured by indigenous populations, marginalized groups, and communities without recognized statehood, the need for alternative monetary systems grounded in the principles of self-determination has become both urgent and undeniable.

Relational liberalism reconceives liberty not simply as freedom from coercion, but as the presence of systems that support both individual and collective financial self-determination. This principle underpins Syron’s approach to decentralized identity and finance, enabling users to engage with technologies that reflect their values. In this paradigm, self-sovereign identity is foundational — catalyzing the emergence of programmable, network state economies.

## Syron's Metaprotocol Architecture: Bitcoin as the Core Collateral Strategy

Syron presents a decentralized metaprotocol built on Bitcoin that empowers users to issue stablecoins pegged to various fiat currencies. All Syron stablecoins are overcollateralized with bitcoin (BTC), ensuring systemic coherence, transparency, and resilience. Through cryptographic and transparent issuance mechanisms, users maintain complete control without reliance on traditional financial institutions (see [Minting](../components/minting.md)).

Although Syron enables the creation of multiple stablecoins — including SUSD and Syron Shekel — all are overcollateralized with BTC. This ensures coherence, mitigates liquidity fragmentation, and concentrates value in a singular, globally recognized asset. TyronDAO’s long-term vision is to solidify BTC as the reserve asset for all currencies issued through the metaprotocol. DAO governance mechanisms will coordinate liquidity and utility across stablecoins, reinforcing Syron’s mission: to enable monetary systems grounded in relational liberalism, self-custody, and financial self-determination.

## Syron Stablecoins: Enabling Self-Custody and Liquidity

Syron SUSD is the first implementation of the Syron stablecoin model. It is overcollateralized with bitcoin held on Bitcoin Layer 1 and secured by the Internet Computer. Users deposit BTC into individual, auditable Safety Deposit ₿oxes to mint SUSD, preserving complete ownership of their assets (see [Safety Deposit ₿ox](../components/sdb.md)). This allows individuals to “be their own bank” — accessing liquidity without relinquishing custody. TyronDAO further supports this ecosystem through a gasless payment system that facilitates fast, transparent donations and peer-to-peer transactions (see [ICPayments](../components/icpayments.md)). As the crypto community reminds us: not your keys, not your coins.

### Case Study: The Israeli Shekel and Financial Control in Gaza

The situation in Palestine provides a compelling illustration of how centralized currency systems can perpetuate economic domination. Lacking monetary sovereignty, Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank are compelled to use the Israeli shekel — a currency issued and controlled by the Bank of Israel. This dependency functions as a tool of financial control, limiting access to liquidity and reinforcing economic subordination under occupation. Following the escalation of conflict in 2023 and the resulting blockade on financial infrastructure, over 90% of bank branches in Gaza were destroyed, and most ATMs remain non-functional. With no new cash entering the territory, only individuals with access to Israeli shekels can buy goods in the few markets that remain operational. The shekel thus becomes more than just a means of exchange; it symbolizes financial exclusion under occupation.

It is important to clarify that TyronDAO does not support authoritarian regimes. Our concern is with the civilian population — particularly vulnerable communities, including LGBTQ+ individuals — who face not only economic hardship but systemic discrimination under conservative and often theocratic governance. Homosexuality is criminalized in Gaza under legacy colonial laws still enforced by Hamas, with penalties including long-term imprisonment. Reports have emerged of executions and severe persecution due to accusations of homosexuality. These realities further underscore the necessity for financial systems that operate outside the structures of political violence and institutionalized oppression. Syron highlights the critical importance of alternative monetary frameworks grounded in self-determination and decentralized access.

### Functional Deployment on Bitcoin Mainnet

The Syron metaprotocol is currently live in testing on Bitcoin Layer 1 with key features such as BTC-collateralized stablecoin issuance, as well as instant, gasless payments powered by the Internet Computer. The TyronDAO dApp allows users to deposit BTC, generate SUSD by minting SYRON BRC-20 tokens (see [Token](../components/token.md)), and convert these tokens back into BTC via secure redemption mechanisms (see [Burning](../components/burning.md)). Ongoing tests are focused on optimizing collateral management, secure redemption flows, and ensuring smooth smart-contract interactions for decentralized payment execution. This infrastructure supports financial liberty and user ownership, offering a scalable, trust-minimized platform for sovereign digital finance. Future milestones include integrating community governance mechanisms and supporting additional fiat-pegged stablecoins. The protocol is evolving — and your participation is welcome as we refine its core mechanisms.

## Conclusion

The crisis of monetary self-determination is neither hypothetical nor distant — it is unfolding in real time, across communities denied basic financial autonomy. From the currency dependency in Gaza to the exclusion of stateless and marginalized groups, centralized monetary regimes continue to impose structural limits on freedom. In response, Syron offers a path forward: a metaprotocol anchored in Bitcoin, designed to operationalize monetary self-determination by enabling communities to create stable, transparent, and verifiably collateralized currencies aligned with their own values and governed on their own terms.

Rather than attempting to replace fiat currencies with a one-size-fits-all alternative, Syron aims to support a diverse ecosystem of stablecoins — all backed by bitcoin collateral and powered by open, cryptographic governance. This design reflects TyronDAO’s broader commitment to relational liberalism: empowering individuals and collectives to co-author their financial futures. As testing on Bitcoin Layer 1 continues and adoption grows, Syron invites builders, communities, and crypto advocates to help shape an inclusive, decentralized monetary solution rooted in financial autonomy and collective self-determination.
